The CADs were completed in the previous term; however, many changes were necessary due to the change of the hardware board within the housing. As stated in previous blog posts, we switched from a Raspberry Pi 3B+ to a Raspberry Pi 4B to take advantage of the added processing power that the newer model offers.

The size of the board is approximately the same as the previous one specified, however the ports are at different positions and are different in nature. For instance, the power port is a USB C female rather than a USB micro. The size and positions of the holes on the back of the housing therefore changed. 

Additionally, the screen ordered was slightly different in size relative to the one used to CAD the initial housing. Upon receiving the LCD touch screen, the dimensions of the housing and the screen cap were changed to fit the new screen.

Finally, since the screen ordered had touch capabilities, it was decided that the button on the design would be removed and replaced with a software button on the screen itself to initiate the translation sequence. 
The next step in the assembly of the device would be to 3D print all of the parts required and assemble the device as a first prototype.
