Traduttore is an invention \n            completed for Group 17's 2022 Mechatronics FYDP. Group 17 consists\n            of Alex Barkin, Alex Alexiou, Cam Nelson, and Danial Mohazab.

For others, \n            the conversation that comes with interacting in service environments is much \n            more difficult. People who use ASL as their main form of communication \n            experience a disconnect in these very situations; it is rare to encounter \n            someone who knows ASL in an everyday service environment like a Starbucks \n            who they can freely communicate with. This often comes with needing additional \n            steps such as writing things down on paper or on a phone in order to communicate \n            back and forth, which is not acceptable with the technologically advanced time we \n            live in. For this reason, there is a need to create a product that bridges this \n            gap in communication between ASL users and everyday service environment workers, \n            which is where Traduttore can come in. `}\n          </p>\n          <h2>About the Product</h2>\n          <p>\n            {`Traduttore is an English-ASL translator specifically designed for service \n            environments that aims to make the experience of communicating between an ASL \n            user and a non-ASL user much easier and efficient. Using gesture recognition, \n            text-to-speech, and speech-to-text technology, Traduttore can make walking into a \n            Starbucks and ordering a drink much easier for ASL speakers that typically experience \n            a gap in communication.`}\n          </p>\n          <p style={{width:'100%'}} >\n          <img className=\"centered-image\" style={{maxWidth:'500px'}} src={danialSign}/>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            {`Thank you for checking out our website.
