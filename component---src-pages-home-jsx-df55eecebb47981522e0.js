For others, \n            the conversation that comes with interacting in service environments is much \n            more difficult. People who use ASL as their main form of communication \n            experience a disconnect in these very situations; it is rare to encounter \n            someone who knows ASL in an everyday service environment like a Starbucks \n            who they can freely communicate with.

For this reason, there is a need to create a product that bridges this \n            gap in communication between ASL users and everyday service environment workers, \n            which is where Traduttore can come in.
