Due to problems with the printer, the print of the housing failed twice, which happened to be largest and longest print, delaying the project. Repairs on to the printer were made within the following days and the print was successful on the third attempt. </p>\n<p>Upon assembling the device for the first time, we realized that the space within the housing was not enough such that all the wires could properly fit. Certain wires also required 90-degree connectors as to avoid bending and damaging the wire over time. Some of the walls of the device were very thin, which did not allow for the threads and screws to be inserted within the plastic properly.\nNew wires, specifically for the USB powering the screen and the HDMI, were ordered with 90-degree connectors and the housing interior and walls were made slightly bigger in order to facilitate assembly. When increasing the size of the housing, we realized that the depth of the device slightly surpassed the size of our constraint, however the team agreed that this would be the best solution and was reasonable to surpass the specification by a few millimeters. </p>\n<p>The next step in terms of the mechanical assembly would be to print the modified parts and assemble the device once more once all the parts have arrived. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 21, 2022","path":"/blog-posts/Blog5","title":"Blog #5"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
