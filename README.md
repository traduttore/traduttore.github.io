Welcome to the code base for traduttore.github.io!
If you've made it this far, then you're either interested in accessibilty, or grading the website...
This website was a fun project that is always being updated.

## üöÄ The Goal

1.  **Create a wicked project.**

Welcome to the Traduttore website. Traduttore is an invention 
completed for Group 17's 2022 Mechatronics FYDP. Group 17 consists
of Alex Barkin, Alex Alexiou, Cam Nelson, and Danial Mohazab. We 
are excited to bring you this project and help ASL users in the
process.

2.  **Solve a problem!**

Many people take for granted how easy it is to communicate and interact 
with people in their everyday lives, especially in service environments. 
For example, walking into a Starbucks and ordering your favourite drink 
from the menu is something that comes very easily for people. For others, 
the conversation that comes with interacting in service environments is much 
more difficult. People who use ASL as their main form of communication 
experience a disconnect in these very situations; it is rare to encounter 
someone who knows ASL in an everyday service environment like a Starbucks 
who they can freely communicate with. This often comes with needing additional 
steps such as writing things down on paper or on a phone in order to communicate 
back and forth, which is not acceptable with the technologically advanced time we 
live in. For this reason, there is a need to create a product that bridges this 
gap in communication between ASL users and everyday service environment workers, 
which is where Traduttore can come in.

3.  **The results!**

Traduttore is an English-ASL translator specifically designed for service 
environments that aims to make the experience of communicating between an ASL 
user and a non-ASL user much easier and efficient. Using gesture recognition, 
text-to-speech, and speech-to-text technology, Traduttore can make walking into a 
Starbucks and ordering a drink much easier for ASL speakers that typically experience 
a gap in communication ‚ù§Ô∏è.
